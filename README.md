## Handwriten Digit Recognition (ML)
Basic Neural Network using `mnist` dataset from tensorflow keras for handwritten digit recognition. 
The `mnist` is a database of handwritten digits in a 28x28px format, with labels.

The goal isn't to create a super accurate prediction on the numbers, but to get used to the tensorflow/keras libraries, the logic behind certain parameters and certain complementary tools.

### Using (pip install): 
    - numpy
    - opencv
    - matplotlib
    - tensorflow
### Usage:
    python main.py
